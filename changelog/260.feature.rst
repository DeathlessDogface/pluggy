Add "new-style" hook wrappers, a simpler but equally powerful alternative to the existing ``hookwrapper=True`` wrappers.

New-style wrappers are generator functions, similarly to ``hookwrapper``, but do away with the :class:`result <pluggy._callers._Result>` object.
Instead, the return value is sent directly to the ``yield`` statement, or, if inner calls raised an exception, it is raised from the ``yield``.
The wrapper is excepted to return a value or raise an exception, which will become the result of the hook call.

New-style wrappers are fully interoperable with old-style wrappers.
We encourage users to use the new style, however we do not intend to deprecate the old style any time soon.

See :ref:`hookwrappers` for the full documentation.
